I asked my favorite AI for a real-world data analyst assignment, knowing it aligns with my love for the Muppets. The task was:

"You work for Muppet Entertainment Inc., and the director (Kermit) wants a report to assess Fozzie Bear’s joke performance over the past 20 shows (June 1–20, 2025). The company is considering a new comedy special and needs data to decide if Fozzie should headline."

Project Overview
Data Source
I imported a custom dataset (generated by AI) into Power BI, featuring 20 joke performances with metrics: laughter ratings, dates, categories (Puns vs. One-Liners), audience size, and performer feedback. The data was clean, requiring no initial Power Query adjustments.

Analysis
Using Power BI, I developed the following visuals:

Average Laughter Ratings by Category: Puns average 6.2, One-Liners average 4.75.
Laughter Rating Trends: A line chart tracks performance over 20 days.
High-Rated Jokes Count: A card displays 12 jokes rated above 5.
Summary
The analysis reveals Fozzie’s Puns (average 6.2) outperform One-Liners (average 4.75), with 12 out of 20 jokes rated above 5. This supports a Pun-focused special, highlighting Fozzie’s strong performance potential.

Design
The report features a professional layout with a headline ("Fozzie Bear Performance Report - June 2025") and a custom green background for Muppet flair.
