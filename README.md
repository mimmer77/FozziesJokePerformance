How did the audience like Fozzies jokes - Power BI report

Fozzie Bear Performance Analysis Report
Date Created: Friday, June 20, 2025

I asked my favorite AI for an assignment mimicking a real-world data analyst scenario, knowing it’s aware of my love for the Muppets. Here’s what I got:

"You work for Muppet Entertainment Inc., and the director (Kermit) wants a report to assess Fozzie Bear’s joke performance over the past 20 shows (June 1–20, 2025). The company is considering a new comedy special and needs data to decide if Fozzie should headline."

Project Overview

Data Source: I uploaded a custom dataset (generated by AI) to Power BI, containing 20 joke performances with metrics like laughter ratings, dates, categories (Puns vs. One-Liners), audience size, and performer feedback. The data was clean, so no initial Power Query cleanup was needed.

Analysis: Using Power BI, I created visuals to analyze:
Average laughter ratings by category (Puns ~6.2, One-Liners ~4.75).
Laughter rating trends over the 20 days.
(Pending: Count of high-rated jokes >5).

Summary: The report suggests Fozzie’s Puns outperform One-Liners, supporting a Pun-focused special (to be refined with specific metrics).

Design: The report includes a professional layout with a headline ("Fozzie Bear Performance Report - June 2025").
